  <h2>Map: Restrictive Covenants in Hartford area, 1940s</h2>
  <iframe src="index.html" width="100%" height="450"></iframe>
  <p>Click on colored rectangles to view restrictions that landowners wrote into property deeds in the 1940s, typically to prohibit occupants â€œother than the Caucasian race." The U.S. Supreme Court approved these restrictions in the 1926 Corrigan v. Buckley case, but later declared them unenforceable in the 1948 Shelley v. Kraemer decision. Yet these restrictions still exist in official property records. To date, we have found 5 race restrictive covenants in West Hartford.
